# Runbook (EOS)

Create `ops/runbook-<service>.md` with:
- Overview & ownership / escalation path
- Health checks & key dashboards
- Common incidents → diagnosis → mitigation
- Rollback procedure (exact, executable steps)
- Feature-flag toggles relevant to this service

> **Next:** return to `/release-gate` (G8) — this runbook satisfies its rollback/canary line items.
