# Backend Rules — Go (optional reference stack)

> Scope note: matches .go. Mutually exclusive with the .ts / .py / .java backend rules.

## Layering
- handler → service → repository. Keep business logic out of HTTP handlers.
- Accept interfaces, return structs. Inject dependencies; no global mutable state.

## Validation & Errors
- Validate input at the boundary; reject invalid early.
- Wrap errors with `fmt.Errorf("...: %w", err)`; never discard with `_`.
- Time in UTC (`time.Time` UTC); money as integer minor units or a decimal type + ISO currency (never float).
- Map errors to HTTP status in one place. Never leak internals to clients.

## Concurrency
- Pass `context.Context` as the first arg on all I/O paths; honor cancellation.
- Protect shared state with sync primitives or channels; test with `-race`.

## Logging & Observability
- Structured logs via `log/slog` (JSON) with request id. No PII. Emit metrics at boundaries.
- Resilience (deterministic, not AI reflection): timeout + backoff-with-jitter + circuit breaker on
  external calls (idempotent retries); short transactions with an explicit atomic boundary; long/blocking
  work off the request path via a queue. Instrument with OpenTelemetry (RED signals: QPS/5xx/p95-p99).

## AuthZ
- Enforce authorization in the service layer; deny by default.

## Tooling (local)
- Format: `gofmt`/`goimports`. Lint: `golangci-lint` (optional install: `brew install golangci-lint`; `go vet` is built-in). Test: `go test ./... -race -cover`.
- `golangci-lint run && go vet ./... && go test ./...`
