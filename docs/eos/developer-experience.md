# EOS Developer Experience — guided workflow & machine contracts

> This is the **contract** document for the guided workflow: the state model, the transition tables,
> the Next-Best-Action JSON contract, the agent/skill mapping contract and the CLI output + exit-code
> contract. It is normative — the implementation in `.github/eos/` and the tests in
> `.github/eos/*.test.mjs` are locked to it.

**The whole point:** you should not have to read EOS documentation to know what to do next.
One entry point, one current work object, one recommended next action, and a machine that refuses
to let unverified work be promoted.

```
Resume / Next  →  do the one recommended action  →  Verify  →  Next
```

## 1. The one loop (what a developer actually types)

```sh
node .github/eos/eos.mjs resume     # what was I doing? what is blocking it?
node .github/eos/eos.mjs next       # the single recommended next action
node .github/eos/eos.mjs check --gate story-ready --scope STORY-012
node .github/eos/eos.mjs transition --scope story --id STORY-012 --to READY_FOR_DEV
```

In Copilot Chat the same loop is `eos-guide` → `/eos-next` → `/eos-resume` → `/eos-status`.
In VS Code it is the **EOS: Next / Resume / Verify Current Gate / Release Status** tasks
(`cp .vscode/tasks.json.example .vscode/tasks.json`, or `eos init --write`).

Nothing here needs the network, a cloud service, a VS Code extension or a package manager.
Want to watch the whole loop before trusting it? `node .github/eos/journey.demo.mjs` replays a
complete feature — blocked story → repair → verify → an input moves (STALE) → recover → merge →
release verdict — in a throwaway copy of this repository, and prints the real output of every step.

## 2. Design principles (why it behaves the way it does)

| # | Principle | Consequence in the implementation |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | State over narrative | The current phase is derived from artifacts, evidence and the ledger — never from a prose summary or a chat transcript |
| 2 | Recommendation over menu | `eos next` prints exactly **one** action; everything else is folded into `--all` |
| 3 | Intent over framework jargon | Entry points are "resume work", "fix a bug", "prepare a release" — not "pick G5" or "pick a BMAD skill" |
| 4 | Branch the flow, never leave an unknown path | Every change type has an explicit gate policy; a skip is a recorded `NOT_APPLICABLE`, never an accident |
| 5 | Free exploration, controlled promotion | Drafting and spikes are unrestricted; `READY_FOR_DEV` / `MERGED` / release promotion require evidence |
| 6 | Progressive disclosure | Default output is six short blocks; detail is behind `--why`, `--all` and `explain` |
| 7 | Never fake a capability | EOS cannot switch a Copilot agent for you, so it hands off honestly instead of claiming it did |

**The LLM may** explain a recommendation, do the work, draft artifacts and summarize failures.
**The LLM may not** mark a gate PASS, approve a waiver, edit workflow state, infer an approval from
prose, or release around the router. Those paths exist only as deterministic code.

## 3. Architecture (four separated components)

```
Project State Model   .eos/project.json · workflow.json · gates.json · agent-map.json · ledger
        ↓
Gate & Transition Engine   deterministic evaluators + evidence freshness + waivers
        ↓
Next Best Action Engine    pure function: state → exactly one recommended action
        ↓
Experience Layer           CLI · eos-guide agent · /eos-next /eos-resume /eos-status · VS Code tasks
```

Layout on disk:

```
.eos/
  project.json          # what this project IS (tracked, authoritative)
  workflow.json         # change-type gate policy + state machines (tracked, CODEOWNERS-protected)
  gates.json            # gate definitions + versions (tracked, CODEOWNERS-protected)
  agent-map.json        # action → agent / prompt / minimal BMAD skill chain (tracked)
  schemas/              # JSON Schemas for every file above
  evidence/             # machine-generated gate evidence (tracked — release evidence must be shared)
  waivers/              # controlled exceptions (tracked)
  ledger/events.jsonl   # append-only, hash-chained transition + gate ledger (tracked)
  handoffs/             # minimal agent handoff context packages (local cache, gitignored)
  local/active-work.json# this machine's current focus only (gitignored, never authoritative)
```

`.eos/local/active-work.json` holds a scope id and nothing else. It never holds a gate result, an
approval, a release state — or a change type, because a change type selects the gate policy and is
therefore authority: a story's classification is read only from the tracked story file.

## 4. State model (three scopes, not one global machine)

### 4.1 Product baseline

```
UNINITIALIZED → DISCOVERY → REQUIREMENTS_BASELINED → PRD_BASELINED → UX_BASELINED
              → ARCHITECTURE_BASELINED → ACTIVE
```

The product state is **derived**, never declared: the engine walks this machine from `UNINITIALIZED`
and advances while the next guard holds. `eos transition --scope product` therefore refuses to set it
by hand and instead names the guard that is still missing.

These states say **BASELINED**, not APPROVED, on purpose. They are reached by a machine finding a
document structurally complete — which is not the same thing as a person having approved it. The one
state that does mean "a human approved this" is the release's `APPROVED`, and it demands an approval
event recorded by someone other than the person who prepared the candidate.
*(Migration from eos-1.12.0: `PRD_APPROVED` → `PRD_BASELINED`, `ARCHITECTURE_APPROVED` →
`ARCHITECTURE_BASELINED`. Product state is derived, so nothing in the ledger needs rewriting.)*

### 4.2 Change / story

```
DRAFT → IN_REVIEW → READY_FOR_DEV → IN_DEVELOPMENT → READY_FOR_TEST → VERIFIED → MERGED
```

Explicit rollbacks are legal (finding a defect must not require lying about state):
`READY_FOR_TEST → IN_DEVELOPMENT`, `VERIFIED → IN_DEVELOPMENT`, `READY_FOR_DEV → DRAFT`,
`IN_REVIEW → DRAFT`.

### 4.3 Release

```
PLANNED → CANDIDATE → VERIFIED → APPROVED → RELEASED → OBSERVED → ITERATED
                                                    ↘ ROLLED_BACK
```

RELEASED is not the end. A change that cannot be observed cannot be judged, and a lesson that is not
written back leaves the specs and the running system drifting apart — so `telemetry-ready` (G9) and
`iteration-ready` (G10) are gates, not good intentions.

### 4.4 Transition table (guards)

Only these transitions exist. Anything else is rejected as an illegal jump — including "skipping
ahead" to a later state whose prerequisite gate has not produced evidence.

| Scope | From | To | Guard (must hold) |
|---|---|---|---|
| product | UNINITIALIZED | DISCOVERY | gate `discovery-ready` PASS |
| product | DISCOVERY | REQUIREMENTS_BASELINED | gate `requirements-ready` PASS |
| product | REQUIREMENTS_BASELINED | PRD_BASELINED | gate `prd-ready` PASS |
| product | PRD_BASELINED | UX_BASELINED | gate `ux-ready` PASS (or a structured non-UI SKIP) |
| product | UX_BASELINED | ARCHITECTURE_BASELINED | gate `architecture-ready` PASS |
| product | ARCHITECTURE_BASELINED | ACTIVE | at least one story exists |
| story | DRAFT | IN_REVIEW | — |
| story | IN_REVIEW | READY_FOR_DEV | gate `story-ready` PASS (per change-type policy) |
| story | READY_FOR_DEV | IN_DEVELOPMENT | — |
| story | IN_DEVELOPMENT | READY_FOR_TEST | — |
| story | READY_FOR_TEST | VERIFIED | gate `verified` PASS |
| story | VERIFIED | MERGED | gate `verified` PASS and not STALE |
| story | IN_REVIEW / READY_FOR_DEV | DRAFT | — (rollback) |
| story | READY_FOR_TEST / VERIFIED | IN_DEVELOPMENT | — (rollback) |
| release | PLANNED | CANDIDATE | — |
| release | CANDIDATE | VERIFIED | gate `release-ready` PASS |
| release | VERIFIED | APPROVED | approval event whose approver is not the requester |
| release | APPROVED | RELEASED | evidence bound to the candidate commit |
| release | RELEASED | OBSERVED | gate `telemetry-ready` PASS |
| release | OBSERVED | ITERATED | gate `iteration-ready` PASS |
| release | RELEASED / OBSERVED | ROLLED_BACK | — |
| release | CANDIDATE | PLANNED | — (rollback) |

A state is **never** read from a Markdown field. If a story file declares `state:` and the ledger
disagrees, the drift itself is reported as a blocker: hand-edited state is not evidence.

## 5. Gates that are machine-verified

Every gate from G0 to G10 is now an evaluator, not a reading exercise. Each stage keeps its human
document **and** a small structured record beside it; the gate reads the record, because prose is
exactly what a gate must not be able to be talked past.

| Gate id | Blueprint gate | Scope | What is actually verified |
|---|---|---|---|
| `activation` | G0 | product | `.eos/project.json` valid, not the untouched template once code exists, `workflowProfile` resolves, activation ledger present |
| `discovery-ready` | G1 | product | `docs/discovery.md` is written **and** `docs/discovery.json` records a falsifiable problem, a metric with a target and a data source, an explicit scope boundary, no unresolved blocker |
| `requirements-ready` | G2 | product | functional requirements, quantified NFRs, and a decision for each of telemetry / authz / audit / rollback / monitoring / canary / quota / i18n / multi-tenancy / capacity-SLO / DR (+ compliance when regulated): ADOPT, SKIP + reason, or DEFER + owner + trigger |
| `prd-ready` | G3 | product | acceptance criteria are **defined** (list item, table row or heading with a statement) — not merely mentioned — unique, and every requirement carries at least one |
| `ux-ready` | G-UX | product | `docs/design.json` says whether there is a user-facing surface; if yes, **both** `docs/DESIGN.md` and `docs/EXPERIENCE.md` exist with content and flows / states / a11y / tokens / responsive are each covered or reasoned N/A; if no, a structured SKIP with a reason |
| `architecture-ready` | G4 | product | stack + topology decided with ADRs, authz / security / audit / rollback / DR / data / API / event decided or reasoned N/A, agentic and regulated concerns when they apply, and every NFR landing on a named component |
| `story-ready` | G5 | story | story references real PRD ACs, every AC has a test intent, LLM-backed ACs have an eval case, telemetry / authz / rollback are decided (ADOPT + owner + verification, SKIP + reason, DEFER + owner + trigger) |
| `verified` | G7 | story | the **tested product tree** is recorded, the declared quality commands ran, every AC has a trace row bound to an existing test file **and** a machine test-run result, evals meet their thresholds with prompt/model/dataset/grader recorded |
| `release-ready` | G8 | release | the candidate is committed, the quality commands re-run **on it**, every story's verification describes **this** tree, spec alignment, secret scan, dependency audit, NFR evidence, compliance boundary, waivers, runbook + rollback + canary + health, topology, enforcement authority |
| `telemetry-ready` | G9 | release | the discovery success metric is emitted as a real signal, dashboards + routed alerts exist, sensitive operations are audited, a rollback trigger is defined, an owner is named |
| `iteration-ready` | G10 | release | learnings are written back into documents that exist, an agentic product feeds production into the eval dataset and re-baselines a changed prompt/model, a named owner records CONTINUE / CORRECT_COURSE / STOP |

`eos explain <gate>` prints the full rule set for one gate on demand — that is the only place the
detailed rules need to be read.

### 5.1 Result statuses

| Status | Meaning | Counts as "may promote"? |
|---|---|---|
| `PASS` | every check passed, evidence is fresh | yes |
| `FAIL` | at least one check failed | no |
| `BLOCKED` | a prerequisite is missing (tool not installed, prior gate absent) | no |
| `PENDING` | the gate applies but has never been run | no |
| `WAIVED` | an unexpired, approved waiver covers it | yes (recorded) |
| `NOT_APPLICABLE` | the change-type policy says this gate does not apply | yes (recorded) |
| `DEFERRED` | a check could not be completed and the reason is recorded (an offline dependency audit, an NFR target with an owner and a trigger) | **no** — visible and time-bound, never green |
| `STALE` | a previous PASS whose inputs or definitions changed | no |
| `ERROR` | the evaluator itself could not run | no |

A missing tool, a crashed validator, an unreadable file or "there are no tests" is **never** mapped
to `PASS`. That rule is the whole reason this layer exists.

### 5.2 Evidence binding and staleness

Every gate run writes `.eos/evidence/<gate>__<scopeType>__<scopeId>.json` binding:
commit SHA · gate-definition version · evaluator version · SHA-256 of every input file ·
the real commands executed with their exit codes · each individual check result · generation time.

Evidence becomes `STALE` automatically when any input hash changes, when an input disappears, when
the gate definition version changes, or when `.eos/gates.json` / `.eos/workflow.json` change — the
governance-change rule. The recorded input *set* must also still match what the gate reads today, so
evidence that simply declares no inputs is stale rather than eternally fresh; a recorded `WAIVED`
binds the waiver file, so an expired, deleted or self-approved waiver invalidates it; and a gate
that asserts something about a *set* (release readiness over the stories) records a digest of that
set, so a story added afterwards invalidates it. Release verification additionally requires the
evidence commit to equal the candidate commit.

An evidence file is an ordinary file, so it is never trusted on its own: its status must be what
its own checks aggregate to, **and** it must agree with the hash-chained ledger, which recorded the
same run and cannot be edited without breaking the chain. Editing one word in a genuine evidence
file is therefore rejected rather than promoted.

**What this does and does not prove.** These are tamper-*evident*, not tamper-*proof*, mechanisms:
the ledger is hash-chained and pinned by `.eos/ledger/head.json` so rewriting, deleting or
truncating it is detected, and the state readers refuse to derive anything from a ledger whose
chain is broken. When a property genuinely cannot be checked, the verdict is `UNVERIFIED` (a
non-zero exit) — never `PASS`. Someone with write access can still forge several tracked files at
once locally — which is why the ledger, the gate definitions, the workflow, the agent map and the
project declaration are CODEOWNERS-protected, and why CI re-verifies the chain against the commit
the build sits on.

### 5.3 What these gates still do NOT prove

Naming a limit is cheaper than discovering it during an incident, so:

- **Threshold provenance.** `docs/evidence/eval-summary.json` carries both the observed value and
  the threshold, and EOS recomputes the verdict from them — a summary reporting `PASS` beside
  numbers that miss its threshold fails. It cannot tell you that the *threshold itself* was lowered.
  The summary is a recorded gate input, so lowering it makes the recorded PASS `STALE` and forces a
  re-run; the diff is what a reviewer sees. That control is human, by design. What a machine *can*
  now check is where the summary came from: `evidencePolicy: "attested"` requires a provider to
  verify the provenance claim rather than accepting the string (ADR-006).
- **Release membership.** A release is currently gated against every story under `docs/stories/`
  that is not a SPIKE or DOC_ONLY. There is no per-release manifest, so a historical story is
  re-verified against each new candidate. That is strict rather than wrong, but it is not selective.
- **Topology cross-checking.** `deployment-topology` requires a decided ADR and `ops-artifacts`
  requires rollback, gradual rollout and health/readiness to be documented. EOS does not verify that
  the mechanisms in the runbook are the ones that topology actually offers — a runbook can describe
  a rollback the platform cannot perform. That remains a review question.
- **The offline claim is now enforced, not promised.** `offline-boundary.test.mjs` fails if anything
  in EOS Core gains a network path or a third-party dependency. That test is the precondition for
  ever adding a provider adapter: an adapter may be online-augmented, but network may only ever
  upgrade an honest non-PASS into a PASS — never manufacture one, and never be silently ignored when
  absent. Without a mechanical boundary, "local-first" erodes one pull request at a time.
- **Server-side enforcement is now answerable, if you let it be.** A local run still cannot see
  branch protection — it is reported BLOCKED/UNVERIFIED, never PASS. A project that configures the
  `github-governance` provider gets a real verdict instead. Only a `PASS` may raise the outcome, so
  an unavailable provider leaves you exactly where you were (ADR-006).

## 6. Change types (branch the flow without unknown paths)

`PRODUCT_BASELINE` · `FEATURE` · `BUGFIX` · `SPIKE` · `HOTFIX` · `DOC_ONLY` · `GOVERNANCE` ·
`RELEASE`. The policy lives in `.eos/workflow.json` and is data, not code:

| Change type | `prd-ready` | `story-ready` | `verified` | `release-ready` |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| PRODUCT_BASELINE | required | not applicable | not applicable | not applicable |
| FEATURE | required | required | required | not applicable |
| BUGFIX | not applicable | required | required | not applicable |
| SPIKE | not applicable | not applicable | not applicable | not applicable |
| HOTFIX | not applicable | waivable | required | not applicable |
| DOC_ONLY | not applicable | not applicable | not applicable | not applicable |
| GOVERNANCE | not applicable | not applicable | not applicable | not applicable |
| RELEASE | not applicable | not applicable | not applicable | required |

`not applicable` is a *decision recorded in the ledger*, not a silent skip — and a classification
that switches gates off cannot simply be asserted. Two rules stop relabelling from becoming a
one-line bypass of everything above: a change type may declare `mergeable: false` (a SPIKE explores
freely but can never reach `MERGED` — ship it as a FEATURE or BUGFIX instead), and a change type
that turns verification off (`SPIKE`, `DOC_ONLY`, `GOVERNANCE`) requires a
`classificationReason` in the story front matter before it may leave `DRAFT`. An undeclared change
type is refused outright rather than defaulted into freedom.

### 6.1 Waivers

A waiver is a file in `.eos/waivers/` with `gate`, `scope`, `reason`, `riskOwner`, `approver`,
`expiresOn` (or a trigger) and `compensatingControls`. It is rejected when the approver equals the
requester, when it has expired, or when the gate policy marks the gate non-waivable. EOS can
*suggest* a waiver; it never approves one.

## 7. Next-Best-Action JSON contract

`eos next --json` and `eos resume --json` emit exactly this shape (`schemaVersion: 1`):

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "generatedAt": "2026-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
  "repo": { "commit": "abc1234", "root": "/path/to/repo" },
  "current": { "scopeType": "story", "scopeId": "STORY-012", "state": "DRAFT", "changeType": "FEATURE" },
  "recommendedAction": {
    "id": "design-acceptance-tests",
    "title": "Design the missing acceptance tests",
    "reason": "AC3.2 has no acceptance-test intent",
    "targetGate": "story-ready",
    "copilotAgent": "eos-plan",
    "prompt": "Create the missing ATDD intent for AC3.2 only.",
    "skills": ["bmad-testarch-atdd"],
    "command": "node .github/eos/eos.mjs check --gate story-ready --scope STORY-012",
    "doneWhen": ["AC3.2 references a test intent", "story-ready check passes"]
  },
  "alternatives": [],
  "blockers": [
    { "gate": "story-ready", "check": "ac-test-intent", "status": "FAIL", "detail": "AC3.2 has no test intent" }
  ],
  "exitCode": 2
}
```

`recommendedAction` is never null: when nothing is blocked, the action is the next forward step
(for example `start-next-change`). The router is deterministic code — the same repository state
always produces the same action, and an LLM is never asked to guess the phase.

## 8. Agent & skill mapping contract

`.eos/agent-map.json` maps an **action id** to at most one primary Copilot agent (or one prompt) and
a minimal BMAD skill chain. Developers never choose from the 73 installed skills.

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "actions": {
    "design-acceptance-tests": {
      "agent": "eos-plan",
      "prompt": null,
      "skills": ["bmad-testarch-atdd"],
      "handoff": "Create the missing ATDD intent for the listed AC only."
    }
  }
}
```

Rules: one action → one primary agent; the skill list stays minimal; a referenced agent file or
prompt file that does not exist makes the action `BLOCKED` with an install/alternative path
(`eos doctor` reports it) instead of silently recommending something unusable. The human-readable
projection of this map is [agent-map.md](agent-map.md); the JSON is what the router reads.

## 9. Handoff context package

`eos handoff --scope story --id STORY-012` writes `.eos/handoffs/STORY-012.json`: scope + state,
the goal, the relevant PRD ACs, approved decisions, the file list with hashes, current blockers,
explicit non-goals, the recommended agent/prompt/skills, `doneWhen`, and the command to return
through. It never contains the whole repository, credentials, unrelated history, unapproved
speculation or production data.

It is a **cache**, not authority: `eos handoff --verify` re-checks the bound commit and input hashes
and reports `STALE` rather than letting an agent act on a stale package.

## 10. CLI contract

```
node .github/eos/eos.mjs <command> [flags]

  status [--changed]        where the project and the active scope are
  next [--why] [--all]      the single recommended next action
  resume                    restore the local focus in a new session
  check --gate <id> [--scope <id>]      run one gate, write evidence
  transition --scope <type> --id <id> --to <STATE>
  explain <gate>            the full rule set for one gate
  release-status            aggregate release readiness
  verify-release --release <tag>        candidate-bound verification
  waive --gate <id> --scope <id> ...    draft a waiver (never approves)
  handoff --scope <type> --id <id> [--verify]
  ledger [--verify] [--against <ref>]   append-only chain verification
  init [--write]            report/create local, non-destructive integration files
  doctor                    is EOS itself wired correctly?

  global: --json  --why  --all  --no-color
```

Default (human) output is always these six blocks and nothing else:

```
EOS · STORY-012

Current
  IN_REVIEW · FEATURE

Blockers
  story-ready/ac-test-intent — AC3.2 has no test intent

Recommended next
  Design the missing acceptance tests

Why
  story-ready is REQUIRED for a FEATURE and one acceptance criterion has no test intent.

Start
  Copilot agent: eos-plan · skills: bmad-testarch-atdd
  node .github/eos/eos.mjs check --gate story-ready --scope STORY-012

Done when
  AC3.2 references a test intent
  story-ready check passes
```

### 10.1 Exit codes

| Code | Meaning | Emitted by |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | PASS / nothing blocking | any command |
| 1 | FAIL — a check failed, or a transition was rejected | `check`, `transition`, `verify-release` |
| 2 | BLOCKED / PENDING / STALE — action required first | `next`, `resume`, `check`, `release-status` |
| 3 | ERROR — EOS could not evaluate (bad config, crashed evaluator) | any command |

`next` and `resume` deliberately exit 2 while a blocker exists, so a script or a task can tell
"there is work to unblock" from "you are clear to proceed" without parsing text.

## 11. Honest capability boundary (VS Code + Copilot)

There is **no supported public API** to force VS Code / GitHub Copilot Chat to switch the active
custom agent from a terminal command. EOS therefore degrades in this order, and never pretends:

1. a Copilot **handoff** button declared in the current agent's frontmatter;
2. the `eos-guide` agent offering the handoff inside the conversation;
3. printing the target agent name plus a ready-to-paste prompt;
4. printing one copy-paste terminal command that does the same work.

EOS does not use undocumented internal APIs, does not modify a VS Code installation, and does not
simulate GUI clicks. Hooks stay advisory (a Preview feature): the CLI and CI verify everything even
when hooks never fire.

## 12. Relationship to the existing gates and validators

The guided workflow **wraps** the existing validators rather than replacing them —
`validate-config.mjs`, `check-doc-parity.mjs`, `eos-doctor.mjs`, `secret-scan.mjs`, `spec-align.mjs`
and `project-gate.mjs` all keep their current contracts and remain the merge authority in CI. The
new layer adds state, evidence and navigation on top:

- the phase table in `/eos-help` is now a *projection* of `eos status`, not a second source of truth;
- the 10-phase flow (G1–G10) in [blueprint.md](blueprint.md) still describes the method; the five
  machine gates above are the subset that is now mechanically enforced per scope;
- existing repositories keep working with no `.eos/workflow.json`: the CLI reports `PENDING`
  activation and tells you the one command that creates the missing files.
