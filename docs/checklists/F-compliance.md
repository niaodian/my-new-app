# F. Regulatory Compliance Checklist (decision per item: adopt / not applicable + reason / defer + trigger condition)

> Walk at **G2 (requirements)** and re-verify at **G8 (release)**. This gate forces *engineering*
> decisions early so regulated constraints shape the architecture instead of triggering a rewrite later.
>
> **⚠ Not legal advice.** EOS is an engineering scaffold, not a compliance certification. It cannot
> replace a compliance officer / legal counsel / auditor. Treat every ADOPT below as an engineering
> commitment that still needs human sign-off. `【New-build】`

## Step 0 — Regime selection (do this first, at Discovery/Requirements)
Tick every regime that applies, then record the result in **two** places:
`docs/compliance-profile.md` (the human narrative, whose first content line is the canonical
`**Regulatory regime:** …` anchor) **and** `docs/compliance-profile.json` (the machine-checkable
profile that `eos-doctor` D5 actually enforces — see "Agentic data-boundary" below). Add one summary
line to `docs/requirements.md`. If none apply, say so explicitly in both — prose
"Regulatory regime: none (generic PII handling per the security rule)" and JSON
`{"regimes": ["none"], "noneRationale": "…"}` — and skip the packs below.

- [ ] **none / generic PII only** (default; still follow `E-security.md` + the data-api rule)
- [ ] **HIPAA** — US healthcare / PHI
- [ ] **PCI-DSS** — payment card data (PAN/CVV)
- [ ] **SOC 2** — service-org trust controls (security/availability/confidentiality)
- [ ] **SOX** — financial reporting controls (public-company finance)
- [ ] **GDPR** — EU personal data
- [ ] **CCPA/CPRA** — California personal data
- [ ] **PIPL / Personal Information Protection Law** — China personal information
- [ ] **other** (name it: ____; find the equivalent controls)

## Cross-cutting controls (any regulated regime)
- [ ] **Data classification** extended with the regulated class (PHI / PAN / sensitive-personal), not just public/internal/PII
- [ ] **Data residency / localization**: where regulated data may physically live; cross-border transfer mechanism named
- [ ] **Audit trail**: append-only + tamper-evident; **retention period stated** (regime-specific); no secret/PII in the log itself
- [ ] **Access control**: least-privilege + **minimum-necessary**; break-glass path is itself audited
- [ ] **Encryption**: at rest + in transit + **key management/rotation** owner named
- [ ] **Data lifecycle**: retention → archive → deletion per class; subject **erasure/export** path (see data-api rule)
- [ ] **Vendor / subprocessor boundary**: a **BAA/DPA is signed *before*** any third party (cloud, analytics, **LLM provider**) touches regulated data
- [ ] **Non-production data**: no real regulated data in tests/fixtures/seed; use synthetic or de-identified data
- [ ] **Incident / breach path**: who is notified, within what window, through which channel

## HIPAA pack (healthcare / PHI)
> **For detailed control → landing-point mapping, see companion appendix [`F-compliance-hipaa.md`](./F-compliance-hipaa.md)** (Security Rule technical/administrative/physical safeguards + minimum necessary + de-identification + breach notification + 6-year retention, mapped item-by-item to real EOS landing points).
- [ ] PHI inventory + **minimum-necessary** access per role
- [ ] **BAA with every subprocessor** (incl. cloud + any LLM/API) *before* PHI flows to it
- [ ] Audit logs retained **≥ 6 years**; access to PHI is itself logged
- [ ] De-identification (Safe Harbor / Expert Determination) before analytics/secondary use
- [ ] **No PHI in third-party LLM prompts/logs without a BAA** (see Agentic data-boundary below)

## PCI-DSS pack (payment cards)
> **For detailed 12 requirements → landing-point mapping, see companion appendix [`F-compliance-pci-dss.md`](./F-compliance-pci-dss.md)** (includes scope-reduction strategy + dedicated Requirement 3 stored card data table).
- [ ] **Never store PAN/CVV/track data**; use tokenization or a hosted-fields / payment-iframe provider
- [ ] Scope minimization + network segmentation (keep card data out of general app/DB where possible)
- [ ] **No card data in logs, telemetry, error reports, or analytics**
- [ ] ASV scan / SAQ path identified as a *process* (external; not a local dependency) `【Optional · needs external body】`

## SOC 2 / SOX pack (finance / enterprise trust)
- [ ] **Immutable audit trail** + change-management evidence (who changed what, approved by whom)
- [ ] **Segregation of duties** (author ≠ approver ≠ deployer for sensitive changes)
- [ ] Periodic **access review**; deprovisioning path on role change/offboarding
- [ ] Named **control owner** per control (accountability, not just implementation)

## GDPR / CCPA / PIPL pack (privacy)
> **For detailed control → landing-point mapping, see companion appendix [`F-compliance-gdpr-pipl.md`](./F-compliance-gdpr-pipl.md)** (lawful basis/consent, DSAR access/erasure/portability, cross-border transfer SCCs vs PIPL security assessment, ROPA/DPIA, 72h breach notification, item-by-item to EOS landing points; includes GDPR vs PIPL differences table).
- [ ] **Lawful basis / consent** captured and revocable; consent state is queryable
- [ ] **DSAR**: access / erasure / portability request handling path exists
- [ ] **Cross-border transfer** mechanism (SCCs / adequacy / localization) named
- [ ] **ROPA** (record of processing) or equivalent kept up to date

## Agentic data-boundary (fires when there is LLM/agent code **and** a regulated regime)
> **The #1 late-stage rework landmine.** Sending PHI/PAN/regulated personal data to a third-party model
> is often prohibited or requires a signed BAA/DPA. Decide **before** building the agent, and land it in
> the architecture — retrofitting this forces a model/architecture swap.

Choose and implement one (not "decide later"):
- [ ] (a) **BAA/DPA signed** with the model provider covering the regulated data, **or**
- [ ] (b) **Self-hosted / on-prem model** so regulated data never leaves the boundary, **or**
- [ ] (c) **Redaction / tokenization gateway** strips regulated fields before any provider call, **or**
  > Runnable starter: `docs/eos/examples/compliance-starter/redaction.mjs` (`assertClean()` boundary guard) — skill `eos-compliance-skeletons`.
- [ ] (d) **Exclude regulated data** from the AI path entirely (design the feature around it)

**Then record it as machine-checkable data**, in `docs/compliance-profile.json`
(template: `docs/eos/examples/compliance-profile.example.json`):

```json
{
  "regimes": ["HIPAA"],
  "regulatedDataCategories": ["phi"],
  "thirdPartyModelPolicy": "redaction-gateway",
  "controls": { "redaction": "implemented" },
  "owner": "compliance-lead@example.com",
  "approval": { "approvedBy": "…", "approvedOn": "2026-01-05", "reviewBy": "2027-01-05" },
  "implementationStatus": "implemented"
}
```

> **Why a JSON file and not the prose doc?** `eos-doctor` D5 used to grep the narrative for the words
> *BAA / DPA / self-host / redact*, so the sentence "no redaction is implemented; regulated data may be
> sent to third-party models" **passed the gate** — the keyword was there, the negation was not read.
> Prose stays for humans; only the enumerated, owned, dated profile authorizes. A control that is
> `planned` / `not_implemented`, a missing owner or approval, an unknown enum value, or an approval
> past its `reviewBy` date all **fail closed**.

Any unresolved regulated item at G2 is a **BLOCKER** (do not proceed to Spec). Re-verify at G8 release.
