# Security & Compliance (thin)

- Validate & sanitize all external input at boundaries.
- Enforce authz at every state-changing operation; deny by default.
- Multi-tenant: scope every data access by tenant from the authenticated context (never client-supplied);
  deny cross-tenant by default (a missing tenant scope must fail, not return everything).
- Secrets only via env/secret store; never in code, logs, fixtures, or the frontend bundle.
  Keep a committed `.env.example` (placeholders) and gitignore the real `.env`.
- Run dependency audit before release (`npm audit` / `pip-audit`). Needs a lockfile
  (`npm i --package-lock-only` if absent); offline it may defer — re-run when online, don't hard-block local work.
- Supply chain: commit lockfiles; pin versions (no floating `latest`); prefer `npm ci` over `npm install`;
  distrust install scripts from unknown packages (`npm ci --ignore-scripts` when vetting); watch for
  typosquatted/newly-published deps. Never pipe a remote script into a shell (`curl … | bash`).
- Scan for leaked secrets: `node .github/hooks/secret-scan.mjs` (also run by CI + eos-doctor).
  Optional deeper scan: install `gitleaks` and secret-scan.mjs auto-uses it (allowlist in `.gitleaks.toml`);
  absence degrades gracefully to the built-in patterns.
- Classify data (public/internal/PII); encrypt PII at rest & in transit.
- Regulated industry (healthcare/finance/etc.)? If a named regime applies (HIPAA/PCI-DSS/SOC2/SOX/GDPR/CCPA/PIPL),
  walk `docs/checklists/F-compliance.md` at G2 and treat its BLOCKER items as deny-by-default. In particular,
  never send PHI/PAN/regulated personal data to a third-party LLM without a signed BAA/DPA (self-host or redact instead).
- Config isolation: separate dev/staging/prod config; least-privilege credentials per environment;
  rotate keys; never reuse prod secrets locally. See `docs/checklists/E-security.md`.
- LLM features: treat model output as untrusted; guard against prompt injection; never put
  secrets/PII in prompts or logs; moderate outputs before acting (see `ai/10-ai-llm` rule).
