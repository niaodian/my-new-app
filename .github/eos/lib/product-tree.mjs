// Tested-product-tree identity — what a VERIFIED actually verified.
//
// The defect this closes (EOS-AUD-001): a gate recorded the commit it ran at, but nothing ever
// re-derived the *content* of the product. So a story could be verified, the source rewritten and
// committed, and the story still promoted to MERGED — every recorded hash still matched, because
// the source was never one of the recorded inputs.
//
// Two properties make this identity usable as a promotion guard:
//   1. It covers EVERYTHING a change could hide in — source, tests, prompts, eval datasets, model
//      and eval config, manifests, lockfiles, runtime and deployment config, schemas — including
//      files that were ADDED, DELETED or RENAMED, which no per-file hash list can notice.
//   2. It is STABLE under EOS's own bookkeeping. Recording evidence and appending to the ledger
//      both write files; if those counted, every gate would invalidate itself the instant it
//      finished, and the guard would be worthless noise instead of a control.
//
// Fail-closed: with no git repository the identity is UNAVAILABLE, and callers must treat that as
// BLOCKED. "We could not tell what was tested" is never "what was tested is current".
